    <h1>VALORANT Agents</h1>
    <p>
      Valorant is a first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot
      Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in
      October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on
      April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The
      development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from
      the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several
      mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while
      moving.

          The genius of Germany. Killjoy secures the battlefield with ease using
          her arsenal of inventions. If the damage from her gear doesn't stop
          her enemies, her robots' debuff will help make short work of them.

          Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat, popping
          off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited by her
          raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.

          Breach, the bionic Swede, fires powerful, targeted kinetic blasts to
